# Analysis of Next Generation Sequencing Data 

# Final Project 

Using bulk-RNA sequencing data, I explore and identify significantly differential genes and pathways activated in lung to brain metastases. Brain metastases are the most common tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) and 40-50% of thesecerebral metastases arise from primary lung tumors (Rute et al., 2018). The prognosis remains bleak and therefore, prevention of brain metastasis is a critical concern in order to improve survival among lung cancer patients. A research project (GSE126548) conducted by Dong X analyses the RNA-Seq to examine primary lung tumors fromNSCLC patients with and without BM and identify differentially expressed genes and potential signalingpathways. There is a total of 6 samples: 3 patients with brain metastasis (BM+) and other 3 without brainmetastasis (BM-). All human cancer tissues used in this study were taken from surgical specimens andpreserved immediately in liquid nitrogen after surgery. The scientists were able to identify a total of 566 differentially expressed genes between BM+ and BM- samples.
