# Introduction

Brain metastases are the most common tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) and 40-50% of thesecerebral metastases arise from primary lung tumors (Rute et al., 2018). The prognosis remains bleak and therefore, prevention of brain metastasis is a critical concern in order to improve survival among lung cancer patients.

A research project (found at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE126548) conducted by Dong X analyses the RNA-Seq to examine primary lung tumors fromNSCLC patients with and without BM and identify differentially expressed genes and potential signalingpathways. There is a total of 6 samples: 3 patients with brain metastasis (BM+) and other 3 without brainmetastasis (BM-). All human cancer tissues used in this study were taken from surgical specimens andpreserved immediately in liquid nitrogen after surgery. The scientists were able to identify a total of 566differentially expressed genes between BM+ and BM- samples, so Iâ€™m eager to see whether I can replicate the data analysis pipeline to pinpoint the genes that play an important role in brain metastasis.

Main Question: In my final project for ANGSD, I would like to explore the following question: What is the difference ingenetic profiles between lung cancers that metastasize to the brain vs those that do not?
